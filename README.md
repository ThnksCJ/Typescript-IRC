## Typescript IRC
This is an IRC server written in Typescript for use with any "client" that can connect to it. 
It is currently a work in progress and uses the TCP protocol to communicate with clients.

## Usage
To start the server, run the following command:
```bash
  npm start
```
This will start the server on port `8765`.

To start the server in development mode, run the following command:
```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome but keep in mind this is nowhere near done. 
Almost nothing is final and I expect everything to changeFor major changes, 
please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
